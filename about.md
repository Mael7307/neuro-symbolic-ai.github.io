## The Neuro-symbolic AI Lab

#### The Neuro-symbolic AI group aims at developing systems which are capable of complex, abstract and flexible inference.

We operate at the interface between neural and symbolic AI methods aiming to enable the next generation of explainable, data-efficient and safe AI systems. Our research investigates how the combination of latent and explicit data representation paradigms can deliver better inference over data.
